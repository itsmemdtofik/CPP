/**
 * ! Stock Buy and Sell â€“ Max one Transaction Allowed.
 * ! Time Complexity : O(n) Space Complexity: O(1)
 *
 * Given an array prices[] of length N, representing the prices of the stocks on
 * different days, the task is to find the maximum profit possible by buying and
 * selling the stocks on different days when at most one transaction is allowed.
 * Here one transaction means 1 buy + 1 Sell.
 *
 * Note: Stock must be bought before being sold.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * Input: prices[] = {7, 10, 1, 3, 6, 9, 2}
 * Output: 8
 * Explanation: Buy for price 1 and sell for price 9.
 *
 *
 * Input: prices[] = {7, 6, 4, 3, 1}
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: Since the array is sorted in decreasing order, 0 profit can be
 * made without making any transaction.
 *
 * Input: prices[] = {1, 3, 6, 9, 11}
 * Output: 10
 * Explanation: Since the array is sorted in increasing order, we can make
 * maximum profit by buying at price[0] and selling at price[n-1]
