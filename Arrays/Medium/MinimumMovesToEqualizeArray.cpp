/**
 * <pre>
 * !Minimum number of increment-other operations to make all array elements equal.
 * We are given an array consisting of n elements.
 * At each operation we can select any one element and increase rest of n-1 elements by 1.
 * We have to make all elements equal performing such operation as many times you wish.
 * Find the minimum number of operations needed for this.
 *
 * @param Examples:
 * Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation:
 * Operation 1 : Increase all except 3rd, we get 2, 3, 3
 * Operation 2 : Increase all except 3rd, we get 3, 4, 3
 * Operation 3 : Increase all except 2nd, we get 4, 4, 4
 *
 * Input: arr[] = [4, 3, 4]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation:
 * Operation 1 : Increase all except 3rd, we get 5, 4, 4
 * Operation 2 : Increase all except 1st, we get 5, 5, 5
 *
 * !Approach: Using Sorting â€“ O(n^2logn) Time and O(1) Space
 * Increments all elements except the maximum one in each step until all elements become equal..
 * The array is modified in-place, and no extra space is used other than the input array.
