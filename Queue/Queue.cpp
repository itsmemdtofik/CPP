/**
 * ! Queue in C++
 * A queue stores multiple elements in a specific order, called FIFO.
 * FIFO stands for First in, First Out.
 * Unlike vectors, elements in the queue are not accessed by index numbers.
 * Since queue elements are added at the end and removed from the front, you can only access an element at the front or the back.

/*
 * 1  | Data Structure | Description
 * 2  | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------
 * 3  | Vector         | Stores elements like an array but can dynamically change
 * 4  |                | in size. Adding/removing elements is usually done at the
 * 5  |                | end. Elements can be accessed by index.
 * 6  | List           | Stores elements sequentially, where each element is
 * 7  |                | connected to the next. Adding/removing can be done at
 * 8  |                | both ends. Not accessible by index.
 * 9  | Stack          | Stores elements in LIFO (Last In, First Out) order,
 * 10 |                | where elements can only be added/removed from the top.
 * 11 |                | Not accessible by index.
 * 12 | Queue          | Stores elements in FIFO (First In, First Out) order,
 * 13 |                | where elements are added at the end and removed from
 * 14 |                | the front. Not accessible by index.
 * 15 | Deque          | Stores elements in a double-ended queue, where elements
 * 16 |                | can be added/removed from both ends. Accessible by index.
 * 17 | Set            | Stores unique elements. Not accessible by index.
 * 18 | Map            | Stores elements in "key/value" pairs. Accessible by keys
 * 19 |                | (not by index).
