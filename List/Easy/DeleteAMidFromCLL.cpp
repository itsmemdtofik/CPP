Deletion from a Circular Linked List

In this article, we will learn how to delete a node from a circular linked list.
In a circular linked list, the last node connects back to the first node, creating a loop.

There are three main ways to delete a node from circular linked list:

1. Deletion at the beginning
2. Deletion at specific position
3. Deletion at the end
Now, letâ€™s look at the methods and steps for these three deletion operations.

Deletion from a Circular Linked List:
Deletion involves removing a node from the linked list.
The main difference is that we need to ensure the list remains circular after the deletion.
We can delete a node in a circular linked list in three ways:

class Node {
public:
    int data;
    Node *next;

    explicit Node(const int data) {
        this->data = data;
        this->next = nullptr;
    }
};


Node *deleteAtSpecificPosition(Node *last, const int key) {
    if (last == nullptr) {
        cout << "List is empty, nothing to delete." << endl;
        return nullptr;
    }

    Node *currentNode = last->next; // head
    Node *previousNode = last;

    /* Case 1: only one node, and it matches the key */
    if (currentNode == last && currentNode->data == key) {
        delete currentNode;
        return nullptr;
    }

    /* Case 2: deleting the first node (head) */
    if (currentNode->data == key) {
        last->next = currentNode->next;
        delete currentNode;
        return last;
    }

    /* Case 3: traverse to find node */
    while (currentNode != last && currentNode->data != key) {
        previousNode = currentNode;
        currentNode = currentNode->next;

    last->next = head;

    cout << "Original list: ";
